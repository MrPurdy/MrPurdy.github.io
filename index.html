    <h1>Things I like to do</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is Cameron and I'm a freshman <br/>
        player and like to hang out with friends <br/>
        and workout. In my free time I like to <br/>
        things like play video games such as Minecraft, <br/>
        Rust, MW3 and plenty of other games. I also <br/>
        like to play board games like Monopaly and Uno. </li>
<br/>
        <li>A few things that I can do for you is <br/>
        design a website, code a website, or help <br/>
        you make your own. When it comes to designing <br>
        I find it pretty easy and not that complicated. <br/>
